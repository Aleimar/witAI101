# Introduction
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is the science of extracting the intention of text and relevant information from text.One of the common applications of NLP is Conversational AI or Chatbots.

## Utterance
Basically, anything the user says. *"What day is it?"* *"Thank you!"* *"I'd like to order sandwich."* Whether a question, an expression or a command, **the whole statement is called an *utterance***. 

## Intents
An intent represents a task or action the user wants to perform. It is a purpose or goal expressed in a user's utterance. 

Intent | Utterance
